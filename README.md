# landing-master-site

This is simple administration panel for download, update, delete and create landing websites.
It works only with json files, so it is for proggrammer only.

User friendly UI is provided in admin panel which provides with every site.

The Project is based on base Nuxt setup. No SSR here, just for compatibility to landings, which is had the same auth flow and admin workflow.
